# WebCrawler
Web Crawler gives us a report of internal linking structure. Basically which pages are linked to which other pages. This can be useful for search engine optimisation experts.

# To Run
Open the main directory and run these commands in the terminal to start the backend server.
```
npm install
npm start
```
After the server has started type "cd WebCrawler" in the terminal to enter the WebCrawler Folder and then run this command in the terminal.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you will be able to access the website by clicking the "http://localhost:3000" link that is generated in the terminal.
